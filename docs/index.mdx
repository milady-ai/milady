# Milaidy

> *your schizo AI waifu that actually respects your privacy*

**Milaidy** is a personal AI assistant that runs on YOUR machine. Not some glowie datacenter. Not the cloud. YOUR computer. Built on [elizaOS](https://github.com/elizaOS), it manages your sessions, tools, and vibes through a Gateway control plane. Connects to Telegram, Discord, whatever normie platform you use. Has a cute WebChat UI too.

tl;dr: local AI gf that's actually fast and doesn't phone home
