## SSRF Protection

**File:** `src/security/network-policy.ts`

All user-supplied URLs (e.g. knowledge ingestion, web fetches) are validated through a multi-layer SSRF defense:

### URL Protocol Validation
Only `http:` and `https:` protocols are permitted. This blocks `file:`, `ftp:`, `gopher:`, `data:`, and other protocol-based attacks.

### IP Address Blocklist
The `isBlockedPrivateOrLinkLocalIp()` function blocks access to:

| Range | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `0.0.0.0/8` | "This" network |
| `10.0.0.0/8` | RFC 1918 private |
| `127.0.0.0/8` | Loopback |
| `169.254.0.0/16` | Link-local / cloud metadata |
| `172.16.0.0/12` | RFC 1918 private |
| `192.168.0.0/16` | RFC 1918 private |
| `::` | IPv6 unspecified |
| `::1` | IPv6 loopback |
| `fc00::/7` | IPv6 unique local |
| `fe80::/10` | IPv6 link-local |
| `::ffff:` mapped | IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (decoded and rechecked) |

### DNS Resolution Verification
**File:** `src/runtime/custom-actions.ts` (`isBlockedUrl()`)

After hostname validation, the `isBlockedUrl()` function performs DNS resolution (via `node:dns/promises` `lookup`) and checks **every resolved IP address** against the blocklist using `isBlockedPrivateOrLinkLocalIp()` from `network-policy.ts`. This prevents DNS rebinding and split-horizon DNS attacks where a hostname resolves to a private IP.

### Hostname Blocklist
Literal hostnames like `localhost`, `metadata.google.internal`, and cloud metadata service hostnames are explicitly blocked.

### Test Coverage
See `src/security/network-policy.test.ts` for comprehensive tests including IPv4, IPv6, mapped addresses, and edge cases.

## Environment Variable Blocklist

**File:** `src/api/server.ts` (line ~812)

The `BLOCKED_ENV_KEYS` set prevents the API from writing to security-sensitive environment variables via `PUT /api/env`. Without this, an attacker with API access could:

### System Injection Vectors (blocked)
- `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` — shared library injection (Linux)
- `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` — dylib injection (macOS)
- `NODE_OPTIONS` — arbitrary Node.js flags (e.g. `--require` for code injection)
- `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` — escape Electron sandbox
- `NODE_PATH` — module resolution override

### TLS/Proxy Hijack (blocked)
- `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` — setting to `"0"` disables **all** certificate verification, enabling MITM of API key traffic
- `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` — redirects all traffic through attacker proxy
- `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` — trust rogue CAs

### Privilege Escalation Tokens (blocked)
- `MILADY_API_TOKEN` — API authentication
- `MILADY_WALLET_EXPORT_TOKEN` — wallet private key export
- `MILADY_TERMINAL_RUN_TOKEN` — shell command execution
- `HYPERSCAPE_AUTH_TOKEN` — cloud service auth

### Sensitive Credentials (blocked)
- `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` — wallet private keys
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — source code access
- `DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_URL` — database connection strings

### System Paths (blocked)
- `PATH`, `HOME`, `SHELL` — system path manipulation

---

## SQL Injection Guards

**File:** `src/api/database.ts`

The database API enforces read-only query execution with multiple layers:

1. **Mutation keyword detection** — Blocks `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `CREATE`, `TRUNCATE`, `REPLACE`, `ATTACH`, `DETACH`, `PRAGMA` (write-mode)
2. **Dangerous function detection** — Blocks PostgreSQL-specific functions that could escape the query sandbox:
   - **File I/O:** `pg_read_file`, `pg_write_file`, `pg_stat_file`, `pg_ls_dir`, `lo_import`, `lo_export`
   - **Sequence/state mutation:** `nextval`, `setval`
   - **Denial of service:** `pg_sleep`, `pg_sleep_for`, `pg_sleep_until`
   - **Backend control:** `pg_terminate_backend`, `pg_cancel_backend`, `pg_reload_conf`, `set_config`
   - **Advisory locks:** `pg_advisory_lock`, `pg_advisory_unlock`, and variants
3. **Read-only mode** — Queries execute in read-only mode as a defense-in-depth measure

---

## Command Injection Defenses

### Terminal Run Endpoint
**File:** `src/api/server.ts` (`/api/terminal/run`)

The shell execution endpoint applies multiple constraints:
- **Token authentication** — requires `MILADY_TERMINAL_RUN_TOKEN`
- **Length limit** — commands are capped at a maximum character length
- **Control character rejection** — newlines, carriage returns, and other control characters are blocked to prevent command chaining
- **Rate limiting** — concurrent shell executions are bounded

### Sandbox Routes
**File:** `src/api/sandbox-routes.ts`

The `runCommand()` helper uses `execFileSync` with argument arrays, preventing shell metacharacter injection for general command execution. Note that `execSync` is also used elsewhere in the file for platform-specific operations (PowerShell commands, `osascript`, `wmctrl`/`xdotool`, audio recording, Docker). Variables used in commands are bounded integers or server-generated paths, never raw user input.

### Custom Actions
**File:** `src/runtime/custom-actions.ts`

Shell and code execution handlers are gated behind explicit configuration flags. The VM sandbox uses `vm.runInNewContext` with a restricted global scope.

---

## Prototype Pollution Prevention

**File:** `src/api/server.ts`

Object property manipulation endpoints explicitly block dangerous keys:
- `__proto__`
- `constructor`
- `prototype`

This prevents prototype pollution attacks that could modify the behavior of all JavaScript objects in the runtime.

---

## Plugin Installation Safety

**Files:** `src/services/plugin-installer.ts`, `src/services/plugin-eject.ts`, `src/services/core-eject.ts`

All `npm install` and `bun install` calls include the `--ignore-scripts` flag to prevent:
- Postinstall RCE from malicious packages
- Lifecycle script execution during dependency installation
- Supply chain attacks via compromised npm packages

---

## Electron IPC Validation

**File:** `apps/app/electron/src/native/desktop.ts`

### `shell.openExternal` Validation
URLs passed to `shell.openExternal` are validated to only allow `http:` and `https:` schemes. This prevents:
- `file:` scheme abuse (reading local files)
- `javascript:` scheme execution
- Custom protocol handler attacks

### `shell.showItemInFolder` Validation
File paths are validated to prevent path traversal and ensure they point to legitimate filesystem locations.

### Context Menu
The "Open Link in Browser" context menu option routes through the same validated `openExternal` helper, preventing bypass via right-click.

---

## Auth & Token Model

### API Token
- `MILADY_API_TOKEN` — Required for authenticated API access when set
- Token is checked on every request in the middleware chain

### Wallet Export Token
- `MILADY_WALLET_EXPORT_TOKEN` — Required to export private keys via `/api/wallet/export`
- Separate from the API token as an additional layer of defense
- Private keys are masked in all other API responses

### Terminal Run Token
- `MILADY_TERMINAL_RUN_TOKEN` — Required to execute shell commands via `/api/terminal/run`
- Separate from API token to prevent accidental shell access

---

## DNS Rebinding Protection

**File:** `src/api/server.ts`

Host header validation prevents DNS rebinding attacks where an attacker's domain resolves to `127.0.0.1` and bypasses same-origin policy. The server validates the `Host` header against expected values.

---

## Configuration Injection Prevention

**File:** `src/api/server.ts`

### `$include` Directive Blocking
The `isBlockedObjectKey()` function (line ~2835) blocks dangerous property keys including `$include` directives across **all object property manipulation endpoints** — not just config writes. This prevents including arbitrary files from the filesystem into any object, potentially leaking secrets or overriding security settings. The same guard also blocks `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` (see [Prototype Pollution Prevention](#prototype-pollution-prevention)).

### Top-Level Key Allowlist
Only known top-level configuration keys are accepted (`CONFIG_WRITE_ALLOWED_TOP_KEYS`). This prevents injection of arbitrary configuration properties.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly through a **private channel** — do **not** open a public GitHub issue, as this risks 0-day disclosure. Use one of:

- **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** via the repository's Security tab
- **Direct contact** with the maintainers
