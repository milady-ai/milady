# Chat Commands

## TUI Slash Commands

These commands work in the interactive TUI (terminal) chat:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|------------|
| `/model [provider/id]` | switch model (opens selector or set directly) |
| `/models` | alias for `/model` |
| `/clear` | clear chat display |
| `/help` | show help |
| `/exit` | quit |
| `/quit` | alias for `/exit` |

## Runtime Commands

The following capabilities are available through the ElizaOS runtime and may vary depending on installed plugins and configuration. They are controlled by the `commands` section in `milaidy.json`:

| Config Key | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `commands.text` | Enable text command parsing (default: true) |
| `commands.bash` | Allow bash chat command (default: false) |
| `commands.config` | Allow /config command (default: false) |
| `commands.debug` | Allow /debug command (default: false) |
| `commands.restart` | Allow restart commands/tools (default: false) |

<Note>
The hook system supports custom command handlers via event keys like `"command:new"` for routing specific actions. See the [Hooks guide](/guides/hooks) for details.
