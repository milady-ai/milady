## File-Specific Lessons

### src/runtime/eliza.ts

- Fix for src/runtime/eliza.ts:289 - No verification result returned, treating as failed
- Fix for src/runtime/eliza.ts:300 - No verification result returned, treating as failed
- Fix for src/runtime/eliza.ts:300 - When a review comment requests both code changes AND test cases, implement both in the same fix attempt—tests aren't optional follow-ups.
- Fix for src/runtime/eliza.ts:300 - tool modified wrong files (scripts/dev-ui.mjs, src/runtime/eliza.test.ts), need to modify src/runtime/eliza.ts
- Fix for src/runtime/eliza.ts:300 - When a review comment explicitly requests test coverage, the fix must include those tests—code changes alone don't fulfill testing requirements.
- Fix for src/runtime/eliza.ts:300 - When a review requests both documentation and test coverage, implement both—comment updates alone don't satisfy test coverage requirements.
- Fix for src/runtime/eliza.ts:300 - When a review requests adding a test case, implement the actual test in the test file—don't just add a comment reminder about it.
- Fix for src/runtime/eliza.ts:300 - When a code change addresses logic, also add test cases that explicitly verify the new behavior and document the intended precedence.

### scripts/dev-ui.mjs

- Fix for scripts/dev-ui.mjs:41 - No verification result returned, treating as failed
- Fix for scripts/dev-ui.mjs:47 - No verification result returned, treating as failed
- Fix for scripts/dev-ui.mjs:47 - When applying a fix, verify the entire diff is syntactically complete and contains no repeated sections before submission.
- Fix for scripts/dev-ui.mjs:41 - tool modified wrong files (.gitignore, package.json, scripts/dev-all.mjs, src/runtime/eliza.test.ts, src/runtime/eliza.ts), need to modify scripts/dev-ui.mjs

### scripts/dev-all.mjs

- Fix for scripts/dev-all.mjs:35 - No verification result returned, treating as failed

### package.js

- Fix for package.json:38 - No verification result returned, treating as failed
